# What you planned to do
1. create a way to add to a shopping list based on a recipe
2. add possibility to add and remove to shopping list with a button
3. add ability to rank recipes, maybe a like/dislike system
# What you did not do
- ranking recipes, didn't achieve this
# What problems you encountered
- learning more with QTTools, the tool is useful but there's a lot to learn with libraries
- troubleshooting the code took a while, lots of errors that are obscure or confusing at first
# Issues you worked on
Shopping list issue: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/1

# Files you worked on
- ShoppingList/main.cpp
- ShoppingList/mainwindow.cpp
- ShoppingList/mainwindow.h
- ShoppingList/mainwindow.ui
- ShoppingList/shoppingListTest.pro
- ShoppingList/shoppingListTest.pro.user
# Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used ChatGPT to error check my code and help solve issues, especially when I was stuck or very confused.
The main third-party tool used was QTTools.
# What you accomplished
My shopping list contains some hardcoded recipes used to test it, the recipes contain ingredients that the user can mark as owned or unowned.
The user toggles these using a checkbox next to each ingredient, which then adds or removes the missing ingredient to the shopping list at the bottom.
Although only applicable for one recipe at a time right now, the final goal is to have it work between multiple recipes.
