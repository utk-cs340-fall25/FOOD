Robert Duardo, Rduardo, FOOD

### What you planned to do
well i wanted to create a function that searches through a list of recipies (kind of like googling a recipie) and then allowing you to filter the reicipies by ingredients wanted (so cake -> only ones with chocolate in it)

### What you did not do
Well i was supposed to add a filtering system to my search function but I was unable to do both as i dont have a system that lists ingredients in a recipie (i cant look up cake and filter to only include chocolate cakes because none of the cakes list any ingredients currently)

### What problems you encountered
Its mostly been trying to figure out how to connect the display screen to the code but i believe ive gotten a handle on it since ive been able to make a 'working' app with just the search function

### Issues you worked on
honestly i cant really point any out than getting off the ground, OH wait i did have issues getting my makefile to work for a good while

### Files you worked on
/Food/RobsSearchFunc is basicly all that ive done and its rather amatureish at best

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
ive been trying to have cursor teach me how to link the apps display to code and figured out that chatgpt is apparently better at teaching that and helped fix my make file

### What you accomplished
I was able to get the app to launch and show up as a simple search function that looks through a handful of hard coded entries
