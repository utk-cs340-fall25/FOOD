### What you planned to do
* Implement the reading of .rcp files.
* Implement the writing of .rcp files.
* Create the .rcp file format.
* Create error codes for exception handling.

### What you did not do
* I acheived what I had planned to do and more.

### What problems you encountered
* The only issues I encountered were ones related to parsing the input file so it can be read properly.

### Issues you worked on
(List the specific github issues that you worked on with a link to the issue (ex: [#1](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/ClassInfo/issues/1) Sample Issue)
We use Trello for our issue tracking. I acheived the File Format, File reading, File writing, and File organization goals.

### Files you worked on
I worked on all the files in ./file_manager and ./error_handler and was the only one to work on them.
I pushed ~300 lines of code.

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I did not use AI or 3rd party tools besides the standard library during this print.

### What you accomplished
I was able to successfully read and write from a file with a somewhat varaible format during reading.
I added numerous error codes so that I can successfully handle errors in an exception-like system. Most of these
error codes were based on the system codes used for by the Win32 API. Although, my code is not windows dependent.
