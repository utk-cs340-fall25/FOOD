# Sprint 3
Name: Pablo Storch
GitHub ID: Durza14
Group Name: FOOD

### What you planned to do
- Convert ShoppingList code into a header that functions [#9](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/9)
- add necessary Shopping list code to main file, allowing for it to work with tab system [#10](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/10)
### What you did not do
- Fully integrate ShoppingList with file system designed for recipe files
- integrate code with recipe API from online
### What problems you encountered
- The filesystem library doesn't work with older compilers, so there are some bugs surrounding the filesystem
### Issues you worked on
- [#9](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/9)
- [#10](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/10)
### Files you worked on
- ShoppingList/ShoppingListWidget.h
- main project/mainproject/main.cpp
### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
- I used some AI to try to understand why the filesystem library wasn't being recognized, as it is a library in C++. I couldn't figure out how to fix it yet though
- 3rd party software used was QTTools
### What you accomplished
- I successfully took my standalone ShoppingList code and converted it into a header that works with the rest of my team's main.cpp file, as our main goal this sprint was to integrate the various segments of our code into one functioning part. As a result, I modified the code where necessary and added the code needed to the main file to allow everything to function.
