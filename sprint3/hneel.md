# Sprint 3
- Ro Neel
- rowobeans
- FOOD

### What you planned to do
- Create the base of how we are going to stitch together the whole project
- Integrate the input into the base properly
- Make the ingredients search not case sensitive
- Work with an api to get data for ingredients and recipes
- Dissect input into it's own header and functions

### What you did not do
- Work with an api to get data for ingredients and recipes
- Dissect input into it's own header and functions

### What problems you encountered
- Stitching everyone's code together turned out to be a bit of a mess as we are still struggling a little bit with the quirks of Qt and how it recognizes project files.
- Group members were apparently using different versions of C++ which caused unrecognized library bugs, but this should be fixed with updating the C++ version.
- Time management issues.

### Issues you worked on
- [Create the base of how we are going to stitch together the whole project](https://trello.com/c/lkvmGgNb/35-start-stitching-together-the-project-by-creating-the-actual-tab-base-to-put-our-widgets-into-sprint-3)
- [Integrate the input into the base properly](https://trello.com/c/BtZ2YObV/37-properly-integrate-the-input-into-the-actual-project-sprint-3)
- [Make the ingredients search not case sensitive](https://trello.com/c/U9CCVF0Q/41-make-ingredients-search-not-case-sensitive-sprint-3)

### Files you worked on
- FOOD/main project/mainproject/main.cpp
- A little bit here and there on other files to help other members with their code

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
- No AI or 3rd party software was used. [Qt's documentation pages](https://doc.qt.io/) were used, and Stack Overflow was used for finding the correct classes and function names. Example code was not referenced this time.

### What you accomplished
- I created the base structure for how we were going to stitch together our entire project and integrated my part of the project into it. I also further tweaked the input section to no longer have a case sensitive search and made the layout and variable names more distinctive. I helped other members integrate their sections into the main project and debugged some issues, too. With this sprint, a handful of the commits could be deceiving as we all collaborated on meshing the project together at the same time in person, and as such, multiple people were responsible for one commit. Some members even committed on other's laptops/profiles. The session was very active and back and forth, so it is difficult to directly point out who did what despite GitHub only crediting one member.
