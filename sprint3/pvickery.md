# Sprint 3

Name: Philip Vickery
Github: PhilipVickery
Group: FOOD

### What you planned to do
1. Add recipe display page to main file
2. Update recipe reading to follow the format of .rcp files
3. Update recipe reading to read through each individual .rcp file

### What you did not do
I was unable to do tasks 2 and 3 on time.

### What problems you encountered
We ran into issues with implementing all of our code into the tab system, but were able to get it working.

### Issues you worked on
 [#1](https://trello.com/c/AOChUhTk/50-implement-recipe-display-tab-to-the-main-file)

### Files you worked on
[main.cpp](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/blob/main/main%20project/mainproject/main.cpp)

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I did not use AI or 3rd party software.

### What you accomplished
I implemented the recipe display page to the main.cpp file, allowing the user to switch between the ingredient input, recipe display, and recipe search tabs.
