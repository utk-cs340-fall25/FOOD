Sprint 2
Name: Philip Vickery
github ID: PhilipVickery
Group: FOOD

What you planned to do
1. Input of a recipe.txt file
2. reading in files from the recipe file
3. displaying recipes
What you did not do
Everything was accomplished.

What problems you encountered
1. Learning how to read a file in QT, since it is different from regular C++
2. Figuring out how to add the widgets for each recipe while the file is being read, rather than adding the widgets at the end like when the recipes were hardcoded

Issues you worked on
[input of a recipes file](https://trello.com/c/9AEXV3LF/38-input-of-a-recipes-file)
[read in recipes from file](https://trello.com/c/DYtfBsQS/39-read-in-recipes-from-file)
[display each recipe](https://trello.com/c/owWIvY8M/40-display-each-recipe)

Files you worked on
FOOD/recipeDisplay/main.cpp

Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I did not use AI or 3rd party software.

What you accomplished
I edited the main.cpp file of recipeDisplay so that rather than having hardocded recipes, it is able to read in a recipes file, create a new widget and layout as each recipe is being read, then display the recipes.
