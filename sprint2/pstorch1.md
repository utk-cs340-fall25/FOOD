# Sprint 2

Name: Pablo Storch
github username: Durza14
Group name: FOOD

### What you planned to do
- add ability to pick from multiple recipes [#2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/2)
- add ability to add custom items to shopping list [#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/3)
- add ability to give items on list priority based on how important they are [#4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/4)
- add integration with file manager from main project to allow for recipe files to be used [#5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/5)

### What you did not do
- the main thing not accomplished was the integration with the file manager, I plan on finishing that next sprint

### What problems you encountered
- the main problem I encountered was syncing QTTools with the GitHub repository, it was very difficult and I didn't fully understand it yet
- as a result, my program couldn't include from other files in the repository, I haven't figured it out yet

### Issues you worked on
- [#2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/2)
- [#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/3)
- [#4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/4)
- [#5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall25/FOOD/issues/5)


### Files you worked on
- FOOD/ShoppingList/main.cpp 

### Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
- I once again used AI when I had a particularly difficult bug I was trying to fix but couldn't figure out, as it could quickly identify and understand the issue
- the main tool used was once again QTTools

### What you accomplished
I greatly improved the shopping list's functionality, allowing the user to actually possibly use it as a shopping list. It can now add multiple recipes and take ingredients from each recipe that you are missing, allowing you to prepare for multiple meals in the future. You can also add your own custom items to the list if necessary, such as if you wanted to buy bananas for later but they were not included in any of the recipes. Finally, you can right-click on any ingredient on the list to assign it a priority, specifically low, medium, and high priority. This allows you to easily see which ingredients are most important to you when shopping.
