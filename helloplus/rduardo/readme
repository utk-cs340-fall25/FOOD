# HelloWorld+ (Anagram Checker)

## What it does
This C++ program checks if a given input string is an **anagram of "Hello World"**.  
- Ignores spaces and letter case.  
- Reports if the input is an exact anagram.  
- If not, it lists which letters are **missing** or **extra**.

## How this relates to our project
This shows basic text parsing and validation in C++, which can also be used for input handling or search features in our group project.
