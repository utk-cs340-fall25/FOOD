Compilation:

Compile with Microsoft's C/C++ compiler or mingw. Should be able
to compile with g++.

Use:

Upon running the .exe, you will be prompted to input any string with
whitespace should you choose. The program will then determine whether
"Hello World" can be created from that string and if so from what letter
positions. Capitalization is handled as well.

How this relates to my project:

This code makes use of std::map which I anticipate I will need to use
either it or some equivalent heavily when implementing a custom database.
