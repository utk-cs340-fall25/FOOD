Program app is found in build-helloplus-Desktop_Qt_5_14_2_clang_64bit-Debug/helloplus.app and was compiled for MacOS. Simply opening the .app runs it on my laptop.

My program features two interactables: a button that counts clicks and a drop down menu selector. Both are good forms of selection, which will be needed for input to do tasks like selecting what food items are available or to confirm selection.
