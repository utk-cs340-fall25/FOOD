This program is a small Qt program that creates a simple desktop app where a user can add ingredients to a list, which will then be displayed.
The user can also clear ingredients to make a new list. This will be useful later in the project as it is a much simpler version of what will be
needed when we make the full desktop app. To run, download the helloplus.zip file which contains helloplus.exe and other necessary files. Then run helloplus.exe and the window will pop up where you can add ingredients.
